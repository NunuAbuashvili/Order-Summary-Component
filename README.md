### Built with

### What I learned

Things I learned while working through this project:

1. CSS background properties, such as background-repeat and background-size.
2. Learned more about Flexbox, for example, how to use flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, etc.

### Continued development

I am not confident in using CSS background properties and would like to work on that in future projects.
